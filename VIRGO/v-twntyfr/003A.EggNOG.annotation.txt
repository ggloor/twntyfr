DNA wrap is dependent on ATP binding by UvrB and probably causes local melting of the DNA helix, facilitating insertion of UvrB beta-hairpin between the DNA strands. Then UvrB probes one DNA strand for the presence of a lesion. If a lesion is found the UvrA subunits dissociate and the UvrB-DNA preincision complex is formed. This complex is subsequently bound by UvrC and the second UvrB is released. If no lesion is found, the DNA wraps around the other UvrB subunit that will check the other stand for damage (By similarity)	COG0556

DNA wrap is dependent on ATP binding by UvrB and probably causes local melting of the DNA helix, facilitating insertion of UvrB beta-hairpin between the DNA strands. Then UvrB probes one DNA strand for the presence of a lesion. If a lesion is found the UvrA subunits dissociate and the UvrB-DNA preincision complex is formed. This complex is subsequently bound by UvrC and the second UvrB is released. If no lesion is found, the DNA wraps around the other UvrB subunit that will check the other stand for damage (By similarity)	COG0556
