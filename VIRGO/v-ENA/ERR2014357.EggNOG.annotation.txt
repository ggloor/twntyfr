V1890496	J	Binds directly to 23S rRNA. The L1 stalk is quite mobile in the ribosome, and is involved in E site tRNA release (By similarity)	COG0081
V1890613	J	Catalyzes the GTP-dependent ribosomal translocation step during translation elongation. During this step, the ribosome changes from the pre-translocational (PRE) to the post- translocational (POST) state as the newly formed A-site-bound peptidyl-tRNA and P-site-bound deacylated tRNA move to the P and E sites, respectively. Catalyzes the coordinated movement of the two tRNA molecules, the mRNA and conformational changes in the ribosome (By similarity)	COG0480
V1890644	L	Hydrolase, tatD family	COG0084
V1890649	S	(LipO)protein	1CA5R@tenNOG
V1890760	F	formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase	COG2759
V1890761	E	Oligopeptide abc transporter	COG4166
V1890771	J	Involved in peptide bond synthesis. Stimulates efficient translation and peptide-bond synthesis on native or reconstituted 70S ribosomes in vitro. Probably functions indirectly by altering the affinity of the ribosome for aminoacyl-tRNA, thus increasing their reactivity as acceptors for peptidyl transferase (By similarity)	COG0231
V1890774	P	ATP-binding (A) component of a common energy-coupling factor (ECF) ABC-transporter complex. Unlike classic ABC transporters this ECF transporter provides the energy necessary to transport a number of different substrates (By similarity)	COG1122
V1890779	V	abc transporter atp-binding protein	COG1132
V1890798	L	damaged site, the DNA wraps around one UvrB monomer. DNA wrap is dependent on ATP binding by UvrB and probably causes local melting of the DNA helix, facilitating insertion of UvrB beta-hairpin between the DNA strands. Then UvrB probes one DNA strand for the presence of a lesion. If a lesion is found the UvrA subunits dissociate and the UvrB-DNA preincision complex is formed. This complex is subsequently bound by UvrC and the second UvrB is released. If no lesion is found, the DNA wraps around the other UvrB subunit that will check the other stand for damage (By similarity)	COG0556
