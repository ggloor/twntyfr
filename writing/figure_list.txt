All samples included

1. a) refseq biplot coloured by taxonomy, b) Subsys4 biplot
2. Heatmap + barplots

Filtered (outliers removed)

3. a) subsys4 with Phi, b) KEGG with Phi
4. BV1 vs BV2 stripcharts
5. subsys4 biplot with correlating metabolomes a) GC-MS, b) NMR
	- Top pannel will be metabolite PCA, bottom pannel the subsys4 biplot with overlaying significant metabolites

Figure points
Fig1
- Organism taxonomy is driving variation
- Once we group to a higher functional level, we have better separation of N and BV (PC1)
- role of the assembled ORFs

Fig2
- Outliers, Nugent, metabolome, define working sample set, color by 4 groups (BV1, BV2, H1, H2)


Fig3
- 2-3 major co-expressed groups
- Same overall big picture from 2 different annotation databses (robust)

Fig4
- Differences are structural and virulence, not metabolic
