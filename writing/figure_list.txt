Update: 8-Feb-2016

All samples included

1. a) refseq biplot coloured by taxonomy, b) Subsys4 biplot
2. Heatmap + barplots
3. Boxplot comparing 16S abundance to mRNA abundance

Filtered (outliers removed)

4. a) subsys4 with Phi, b) KEGG with Phi
5. BV1 vs BV2 stripcharts
6. subsys4 biplot with correlating metabolomes a) GC-MS, b) NMR
	- Top pannel will be metabolite PCA, bottom pannel the subsys4 biplot with overlaying significant metabolites

Figure points
Fig1
- Organism taxonomy is driving variation
- Once we group to a higher functional level, we have better separation of N and BV (PC1)
- role of the assembled ORFs

Fig2
- Outliers, Nugent, metabolome, define working sample set, color by 4 groups (BV1, BV2, H1, H2)


Fig4
- 2-3 major co-expressed groups
- Same overall big picture from 2 different annotation databses (robust)

Fig5
- Differences are structural and virulence, not metabolic
