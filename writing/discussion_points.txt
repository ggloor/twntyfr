Discussion

[some bits about the last 3 bullets here]

- Separate N and BV (transcript and metabolome)
    - Lacto subgroups
        - Crispatus matches CST 1 (Ravel)
        - Other lacto group is more diverse
            - Likely under sampled (expect iners, jensenii, gass/john)
- Two predicted BV subgroups (transcriptome only, not metabolome) - largely separate by (inferred) BVAB1
    - BVAB1 and Mobiluncus
    - The BVAB1 functions are structural, not metabolic (largely)
        - redundancy in functions (see below)
- Taxa:
    - Distinct Megasphaera and prevotella groups, not G. vag
    - iners is non-discriminatory
    - 1 mega discriminatory, the other is not
    - Atopobium rare transcriptomically compared to 16S relative abundance (vice versa for Megaspaera, and maybe Prevotella)
        - Assembly did not add any more transcripts to Ato
            - Not metabolically active (at sample time) - e.g. 013B
            - (literature - marker BV)
    - Assembly
        - Presumably BVAB1
        - Didn’t add much new (we mostly assembled things we had in the database), but separates the BV subtypes
- Functional grouping (subsys4 and KEGG) - discriminatory power
    - Better separation of BV and N - larger PC1
    - Meta-organism instead of individual organisms
        - Redundancy in functions - different species contribute to same functions
- Outliers/oddballs
    - 019A - 16S iners, but Nugent BV, transcript outlier, metabolically BV
    - 015B - Bifido, nugent healthy, transcriptional outlier
    - 003A, 008B, 001A - Nugent difficult (BV and intermediate)
        - transcriptionally ambiguous (don’t lie in the major groups)
        - 001A and 008B are healthy metabolically, 3A are BV
        - Open ended: how to deal or treat with these clinically

[put some of this at the beginning]

- Used two high-resolution methods (metabolome, and RNAseq)
    - Agreements (amines, succinate, BV v H), but differ
    - Need both to get a more holistic view
        - inferring from 16S would be misleading: organism abundance and transcript abundance not necessarily related….and out to small molecules detected
        - Still need virome and proteome, etc.
- Limitations of databases (metabolomic pathways, what we can detect for small molecules, RNAseq annotation rate to KEGG and SEED)
- Method for compositional analysis and combining multi-omic datasets
    - Difficulty in combining absolute and relative datasets
        - Can’t directly correlate metabolite abundance with transcripts to pick out pathways (need to know what to look for)
