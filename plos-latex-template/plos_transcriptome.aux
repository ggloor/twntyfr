Compositional biplots are Principle Component (PC) Plots generated from the singular value decomposition of the centre log-ratio transformed dataset \cite  {aitchison2002biplots}. The bottom and left axes show the unit scaled measures for PC1 and 2, and the top and right axes show unit scaled variances for the transcripts. These plots thus show the relationship between sample distance along with the contribution of the transcripts to that distance. In this plot component 1 and 2 explain over 58\% of the variance in the dataset, which is exceptional for a dataset of this complexity. Sample names are shown in black text. All samples partitioning with negative values on PC1 were classified by Nugent scoring as clinically healthy, and all samples with positive PC1 values were classified by Nugent scoring as clinically BV. The location of each transcript is shown as a coloured point, with the colors corresponding to the taxonomic assignment of the centroid sequence. Panel B shows a biplot where the transcripts are summed by SEED subsystem 4 annotation. Panel C shows the taxonomic distribution of the samples inferred by sequencing the V6 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene , the inferred composition based on the taxonomic assignments of the RNA-seq reads, and a dendrogram and associated heat map based on the similarity between samples based on SEED subsystem 4 function abundance.\relax }}{5}{figure.caption.13}}
