Panel C shows the taxonomic distribution of the samples inferred by sequencing the V6 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene , the inferred composition based on the taxonomic assignments of the RNA-seq reads, and a dendrogram and associated heat map based on the similarity between samples based on SEED subsystem 4 function abundance.\relax }}{4}{figure.caption.13}}
